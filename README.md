# react-native-neumorphic-ui

This is currently a WIP library developing neumorphic-style UI designs. Inspired by [Max Osichka's skeumorphic music player](https://dribbble.com/shots/8869880-Skeuomorphic-Music-Player-Dark-Theme).

## Technology Overview

I come from a web background so I tried to use familiar tools from the web in order to create this UI library. I've used react-native styled-components and styled-system to get a "styled system" up and running extremely quickly.
